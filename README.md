## **Major Note**
For some reason, TrackJS doesn't load in Firefox. It works in Chrome and Edge. I did not write TrackJS, so I do not know why it fails like this - nor do I have any idea what in their minified code is causing the issue. It happens both on local copies and on Pages, so I wanted to make sure this was noted before submission.
